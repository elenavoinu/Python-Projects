''' @Elena Voinu
Write a while loop that prints user_num divided by 2 until user_num is less than 1. 
The value of user_num changes inside of the loop. 
Sample output for the given program:
10.0
5.0
2.5
1.25
0.625 '''

user_num = 20

''' Your solution goes here '''
while user_num >=1:
    user_num=user_num/2
    print(user_num)
